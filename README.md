# Welcome to Checkmate 2.1

Checkmate is an open-source, self-hosted tool designed to track and monitor server hardware, uptime, response times, and incidents in real-time with beautiful visualizations.

It uses [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture) to get data from remote servers and doesn't need anything other than the Checkmate server itself to monitor uptime and page speed.
