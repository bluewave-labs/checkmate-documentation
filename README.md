# Welcome to Checkmate

Checkmate is an open-source, self-hosted tool designed to track and monitor server hardware, uptime, response times, and incidents in real-time with beautiful visualizations.

It uses [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture) to get data from remote servers and doesn't need anything other than the Checkmate server itself to monitor uptime and page speed.

## Demo

We have a [demo](https://checkmate-demo.bluewavelabs.ca) where you can test how the Uptime Manager works. The username is **uptimedemo@demo.com** and the password is **Demouser1!**
