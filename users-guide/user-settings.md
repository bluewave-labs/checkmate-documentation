In order to change your password, you need to enter your password, and the new password twice. The new password must meet the specified criteria (e.g., minimum length, uppercase letter, number, symbol).

**Additional notes:**

* Your new password will take effect immediately.
* For security reasons, it is recommended to choose a strong password that is difficult to guess.

* Click the "Invite a team member" button.
* Enter the email address of the person you want to invite.

* Click "Invite" to send the invitation.
